## Hello there!

Welcome to ETHTPS. This is the place for the second version of ethtps.info, a website that provides information about Ethereum network's the number of transactions per second and their complexity.

The website is currently under construction and a public alpha will follow soon. The first version of the website can be found [here](https://ethtps.info/).

You can check out our public repos [here](https://github.com/orgs/ethtps/repositories). Here are some quick links to the most important ones:

- [backend](https://github.com/ethtps/ethtps.backend) (API)

- [frontend](https://github.com/ethtps/ethtps.frontend)

Please note that not all repos are public yet. We will make all required code public as soon as possible.
